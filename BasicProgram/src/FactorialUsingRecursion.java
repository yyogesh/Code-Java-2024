/*
 * Factorial Using Recursion
 * --------------------------
 * In mathematics, the factorial of a positive integer n,
 * denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers
 * less than or equal to n:
 *
 *  n! can be written as
 *  n! = 1 * 2 * 3 * .... * (n-1) * n;
 *
 *  n! can also be written as
 *  n! = n * (n-1)!
 *  This approach helps to calculate using Recursion
 *
 *  5! = 5 * 4!
 *  4! = 4 * 3!
 *  3! = 3 * 2!
 *  2! = 2 * 1!
 *  1! = 1
 *
