 * Factorial
 * ----------
 * In mathematics, the factorial of a positive integer n,
 * denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers
 * less than or equal to n:
 *
 *  n! can be written as
 *  n! = 1 * 2 * 3 * .... * (n-1) * n;
 *
 *  n! can also be written as
 *  n! = n * (n-1)!
 *
 * say N = 4: Factorial 4 ( 4! ) is equal to 24.
 * 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1;
 * 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1;
 * 5! = 5 * 4!
